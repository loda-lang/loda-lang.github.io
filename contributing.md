LODA is a collaborative, open-source project dedicated to discovering, analyzing, and sharing integer sequence programs. There are several ways you can get involved and make meaningful contributions.

## Program Mining

Help discover new and more efficient programs for integer sequences by running LODA miners. Mining is a community effort, and every contribution helps expand the database of known programs. There are two ways to contribute to the distributed mining:

- Join the [LODA project on BOINC](https://boinc.loda-lang.org/loda/), or
- Run local miners using the [LODA command-line tool](/install).

All mined programs are credited to their contributors and stored in the [loda-programs](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs) repository. You can track mining progress and statistics on the [mining dashboard](https://dashboard.loda-lang.org/grafana/). Top contributors are recognized on the [LODA BOINC leaderboard](https://boinc.loda-lang.org/loda/top_users.php).

## Contributing to the Codebase

LODA is open source and welcomes code contributions of all kinds:

- **Report bugs or request features:** Open an issue in the relevant [loda-lang GitHub repository](https://github.com/loda-lang).
- **Submit pull requests:** Help improve the miners, web tools, documentation, or other components. See the repository README for setup and contribution guidelines.
- **Join the discussion:** Connect with the community on [Discord](https://loda-lang.org/discord) or via e-mail for questions, ideas, or collaboration.
