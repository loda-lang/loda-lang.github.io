The LODA command-line tool is available for Linux, macOS and Windows. To install it, follow the instructions for your operating system below. If you are only interested in program mining, you can also join the [LODA project on BOINC](https://boinc.loda-lang.org/loda/) and skip the manual installation.

# Linux and macOS

Please make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
To download and install LODA, run this command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loda-lang/loda-cpp/main/install.sh)"
```

# Windows

Before installing LODA, you need to install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Then click on the start menu and type **Git CMD**. Open this app and execute the following commands:

```
md "%USERPROFILE%\loda\bin"
cd "%USERPROFILE%\loda\bin"
curl -fsSLo loda.exe https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-cpp/releases/latest/download/loda-windows.exe
loda setup
```

## Getting Started

To evaluate the program of the OEIS sequence for the Fibonacci numbers, run `loda eval A000045`.
To run the miner to search for new or better programs, execute `loda mine` (single core) or `loda mine -p` (multi-core). A detailed overview of all commands and options is shown below.

```
Usage: loda <command> <options>

Core Commands:
  evaluate <program>  Evaluate a program to an integer sequence (see -t,-b,-s)
  export   <program>  Export a program print result (see -o)
  optimize <program>  Optimize a program and print it
  minimize <program>  Minimize a program and print it (see -t)
  profile  <program>  Measure program evaluation time (see -t)
  setup               Run interactive setup to configure LODA

OEIS Commands:
  mine                Mine programs for OEIS sequences (see -i,-p,-P,-H)
  check <program>     Check a program for an OEIS sequence (see -b)
  mutate <program>    Mutate a program and mine for OEIS sequences
  submit <file> [id]  Submit a program for an OEIS sequence

Targets:
  <file>              Path to a LODA file (file extension: *.asm)
  <id>                ID of an OEIS integer sequence (example: A000045)
  <program>           Either an <file> or an <id>

Options:
  -t <number>         Number of sequence terms (default: 10)
  -b                  Print result in b-file format from offset 0
  -B <number>         Print result in b-file format from a custom offset
  -o <string>         Export format (formula,loda,pari)
  -d                  Export with dependencies to other programs
  -s                  Evaluate program to number of execution steps
  -c <number>         Maximum number of interpreter cycles (no limit: -1)
  -m <number>         Maximum number of used memory cells (no limit: -1)
  -l <string>         Log level (values: debug,info,warn,error,alert)
  -i <string>         Name of miner configuration from miners.json
  -p                  Parallel mining using default number of instances
  -P <number>         Parallel mining using custom number of instances
  -H <number>         Number of mining hours (default: unlimited)
```

## Updating LODA

To install updates, run `loda setup`. This command will check if updates are available and ask you whether to install them.
