The LODA command-line tool lets you explore, evaluate, and mine programs for integer sequences. It's available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Follow the instructions below to get started on your platform.

If you only want to contribute compute power for program mining, you can join the [LODA project on BOINC](/connect#boinc-distributed-computing) and skip manual installation.

## Linux & macOS

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. Then run this command in your terminal:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loda-lang/loda-cpp/main/install.sh)"
```

## Windows

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. Open the **Git CMD** app from your Start menu.
3. Run these commands:

```powershell
md "%USERPROFILE%\loda\bin"
cd "%USERPROFILE%\loda\bin"
curl -fsSLo loda.exe https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-cpp/releases/latest/download/loda-windows.exe
loda setup
```

## Getting Started

Try evaluating a classic sequence. For example, to compute the Fibonacci numbers:

```bash
loda eval A000045
```

To start mining for new or better programs:

```bash
loda mine         # Single core
loda mine -p      # Multi-core (parallel)
```

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
loda upgrade
```

For a full list of commands and options, run `loda --help` or see below:
