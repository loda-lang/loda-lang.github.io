LODA is an open-source project for discovering, analyzing, and sharing concise programs that generate integer sequences—especially those from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences® (OEIS®)](https://oeis.org/).

LODA combines a minimalist assembly-like language, a distributed mining platform, and a vibrant community of contributors. Our mission: to reverse engineer formulas and efficient algorithms for a wide range of non-trivial integer sequences, advancing both mathematical knowledge and automated program discovery.

## What is LODA?

- ✨ **A Language:** LODA (_Lexicographical Order Descent Assembly_) is a simple, assembly-inspired language designed for expressing number-theoretic algorithms and integer sequences in a compact, human- and machine-friendly way.
- 🤖 **A Mining Platform:** Harness distributed compute power and smart search algorithms to automatically discover new programs and formulas for OEIS sequences.
- 🌍 **A Community:** Join researchers, enthusiasts, and contributors in exploring the world of integer sequences, program mining, and algorithmic discovery.

## Key Features

- **Minimalist Syntax:** Easy to read, write, and analyze.
- **Rich Arithmetic & Number Theory:** Supports a wide range of operations for concise, powerful programs.
- **Automated Program Mining:** Distributed miners and machine learning help uncover new algorithms every day.
- **Open & Collaborative:** All programs and tools are open source. Contributions are welcome!

## Get Started

- 🔎 **Explore Programs:** Browse the [LODA program database](https://programs.loda-lang.org/) to see thousands of programs for OEIS sequences.
- 📖 **Learn the Language:** Read the [LODA specification](/spec) for a complete guide to syntax, memory, and operations.
- 🛠️ **Try Mining:** Contribute compute power or run your own miner—see [how to contribute](/contributing).
- 💡 **Submit Your Program:** Have a new or improved program? Submit it via the [API](https://api.loda-lang.org/v2/openapi) or GitHub.
- 💬 **Join the Community:** Connect on [Discord](https://loda-lang.org/discord) for help, discussion, and collaboration.

## Why LODA?

LODA makes it possible to:

- Discover new mathematical relationships and formulas.
- Automate the search for efficient algorithms.
- Contribute to a growing, open database of integer sequence programs.
- Learn and experiment with number theory, programming, and algorithmic thinking.
