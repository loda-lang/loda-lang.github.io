LODA includes tools for mining new and more efficient programs for integer sequences. There are continuously running miners generating programs and formulas every day. You can use the [mining&npsp;dashboard](http://dashboard.loda-lang.org/grafana) to get an overview of the currently running miners. Below you see a chart of the number of programs since the start of the project.

You have two options for mining programs:

1. Join the [LODA project on BOINC](https://boinc.loda-lang.org/loda/).
2. Use the [LODA command-line tool](/install).

We honor your contributions: you can include your name in mined programs. All mined programs are stored in the [loda-programs](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs) repository.

To receive updates on new miner findings, you can check out the [latest commits](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/commits/main) or subscribe to the [@lodaminer](https://twitter.com/lodaminer) channel on Twitter, or [join us on Slack](https://loda-lang.slack.com/). It includes a channel that posts new programs in real-time.
